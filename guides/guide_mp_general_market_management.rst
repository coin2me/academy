      :description lang=ru: Создайте собственный магазин бесплатно. Функция "Рынки и магазины" от Particl позволяет создавать неограниченное количество торговых площадок для товаров и услуг. Спасибо технологии блокчейн.
      :description lang=en: Own your own storefront for free. Particl's Markets & Storefronts enables you to setup an unlimited number of marketplaces for goods and services. Thanks to blockchain technology.

Основное различие между рынками и магазинами заключается в том кто имеет право размещать там объявления о продаже. Рынок позволяет всем участникам публиковать такие объявления, а магазин - только тем, у кого есть определенный ключ для публикации. 

.. note::

   Для упрощения терминологии "рынки" и "магазины" называются как "пользовательские рынки".

Create and join an unlimited number of community markets with the :term:`Particl Marketplace`. Each of these markets can host an equally-unlimited number of listings and live independently from the predefined :term:`Open Market`.

By default, a community market isn’t publicly visible and is only known to its creator. However, a community market can be promoted within the :term:`Market Browser`, making it available to join at the click of a button. Of course, you can grant direct access as well.

Create a Community Market
-------------------------

These four steps aren't hard to follow, and they can help you start a brand new journey for you or your business.

.. rst-class:: bignums

  #. Open :guilabel:`Market` -> :guilabel:`MANAGE MARKETS` -> :guilabel:`Your Markets` and click on the :guilabel:`Create new Market` button to start the market creation process.
  #. Enter a title, a short description, a picture for your market, and then choose the region your market targets (can be worldwide). 
  #. Select the :guilabel:`Community Market` or :guilabel:`Storefront` option depending on your preference.
  #. Click on :guilabel:`Confirm & Create Market` to review the details of your market.

Your community market is now created. You can promote it to the Market Browser so that anyone can easily access it or keep its Market ID and Access Key private. Doing that will let you share the access information to only the people you want to. 

.. attention::

   Anyone with access to the Publish Key (storefont) can share it with anyone else. Only share the Publish Key with people you trust and know won't leak it out.

**Publish Listings**

To publish listings to your new community market, go through the normal :doc:`product listing process <../guides/guide_mp_vendor_understanding_sellflow>` and choose your community market when ready to publish your item(s). 

Promote a Market
------------------

Make your community market publicly visible in the :term:`Market Browser` and let anyone in the world join it and purchase items. 

.. rst-class:: bignums

  #. Open :guilabel:`Market` -> :guilabel:`MANAGE MARKETS` -> :guilabel:`Your Markets`.
  #. Click on the market tile you want to promote and click on the :guilabel:`Promote in Market Browser` icon at the bottom of the expanded tile to open the market promotion window.
  #. Select the number of days you want to promote your market and confirm with a click on :guilabel:`Promote Market` to promote it.

.. hint::

 Anyone is able and free to promote any market they wish.

Browse the Markets
------------------

Explore and join all the community markets that their creators or other community members have promoted.

.. rst-class:: bignums

  #.  Open :guilabel:`Market` -> :guilabel:`MANAGE MARKETS` -> :guilabel:`Browser`.
  #. Browse the publicly accessible community markets and find one you want to join.
  #. Click on its tile to expand its options and click on :guilabel:`Join this Market` to connect to it.

.. hint::

 #. Open :guilabel:`Market` -> :guilabel:`MANAGE MARKETS` -> :guilabel:`Your Markets` to see all the markets you have joined.
 #. You can browse the market's listings by :guilabel:`Market` -> :guilabel:`BROWSE` and selecting the community market in the :guilabel:`FILTER` section.

Join a Market
-------------

If you have in your possession the Market ID and Access/Publish Key of a particular community market, you can directly join it even if it's not promoted on the Market Browser. If you only have the Access Key of a storefront, you will only be able to buy items. If you instead possess its Publish Key, then you'll be able to join as a full vendor and also sell items. 

.. rst-class:: bignums

  #. First, make sure you possess the Market ID and Market Access Key of the market/storefront you want to join. You may need to collect this information from private sources if its creator or users do not publicly broadcast them.
  #. Open :guilabel:`Market` -> :guilabel:`MANAGE MARKETS` -> :guilabel:`Browser` and click on the :guilabel:`Join via Market ID` button to expand the window to join a new market.
  #. Fill in the community market's information. You can entirely decide this information to help you better organize your markets and know what they’re about.
  #. Enter the community market's Market ID and Access/Publish Key, and then click on the :guilabel:`Join this Market` button to join the community market.

.. hint::

 #. Open :guilabel:`Market` -> :guilabel:`MANAGE MARKETS` -> :guilabel:`Your Markets` to see all the markets you have joined.
 #. You can browse the market's listings by :guilabel:`Market` -> :guilabel:`BROWSE` and selecting the community market in the :guilabel:`FILTER` section.

Flag Markets
------------

If you see a community market with inappropriate content, you can flag it to the rest of the Particl community. If enough people flag the market, it will be taken down from the :term:`Particl Network` altogether. To learn more about the :term:`Particl Marketplace` moderation mechanism, read :doc:`Market Moderation Explained <../in-depth/indepth_mp_moderation>`.

.. rst-class:: bignums

  #. Open :guilabel:`Market` -> :guilabel:`MANAGE MARKETS` -> :guilabel:`Your Markets`.
  #. Click on the tile of the community market you want to flag to expand its options.
  #. Click on :guilabel:`Report Inappropriate Market` to open the Flagging window and click on the :guilabel:`Flag this market` button to flag it.

.. hint::

  The total number of coins you hold in your :guilabel:`Public` balance will now be used as downvotes for this community market. If the market's moderation score goes below |Threshold|, it will be taken off the :term:`Particl Network`.

Vote to Keep a Market
---------------------

Sometimes, other users may flag community markets that you believe should remain on Particl. In those cases, you need to make your voice hear. To learn more about the :term:`Particl Marketplace` moderation mechanism, read :doc:`Market Moderation Explained <../in-depth/indepth_mp_moderation>`.

.. rst-class:: bignums

  #. In the window that appears, click on the :guilabel:`Keep Market` green button to confirm that you believe this market shouldn't be moderated out.

.. hint::

  The number of coins you hold in your :guilabel:`Public` balance will now be used as upvotes for this community market. As long as the market's overall moderation score doesn't go below |Threshold|, the market will remain on the :term:`Particl Network`.
